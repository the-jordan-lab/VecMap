# Pre-Publication Checklist

Based on the critical appraisal, here's the final checklist before making the repository public and submitting to bioRxiv:

## ✅ Completed Items

- [x] **Repository cleanup** - Removed all internal development files, professional README
- [x] **Version tagging** - Released as v1.0.0 with git tag
- [x] **Reproducibility script** - Created `reproduce.sh` for one-command reproduction
- [x] **Variance reporting** - All benchmarks report mean ± SD over 3 replicates
- [x] **Random seeds** - Fixed seeds documented (42 for general, 12345 for CRISPR)
- [x] **Hardware/software specs** - Added to README and DATA_AVAILABILITY.md
- [x] **Reference list** - Complete hyperlinked list in REFERENCES.md
- [x] **Data availability** - Clear statement in DATA_AVAILABILITY.md
- [x] **Diagram prompt** - Saved in docs/DIAGRAM_PROMPT.md for Figure 2

## ⚠️ To Do Before Publication

### 1. Create Zenodo Archive
```bash
# Run benchmarks to generate data
./reproduce.sh

# Create archive
tar -czf vecmap_v1.0.0_reproduction.tar.gz \
    benchmark_results/ \
    figures/ \
    reproducibility_report.txt \
    benchmarks/scripts/ \
    DATA_AVAILABILITY.md

# Upload to Zenodo and get DOI
```

### 2. Update Manuscript
- [ ] Add Zenodo DOI to Data Availability section
- [ ] Add exact git commit hash (57079ae) to Methods
- [ ] Generate Figure 2 using the diagram prompt
- [ ] Update bioRxiv DOI once assigned

### 3. Final Documentation Updates
```bash
# Update README.md with real bioRxiv DOI
sed -i 's/10.1101\/2025.XX.XX.XXXXXX/ACTUAL_DOI/' README.md

# Update citation in manuscript files
```

### 4. GitHub Release
```bash
# Create GitHub release from v1.0.0 tag
# Include:
# - Link to bioRxiv preprint
# - Link to Zenodo data archive
# - Summary of key performance results
```

## Repository Status Summary

The VecMap repository is now:
- **Clean**: Professional structure, no development artifacts
- **Reproducible**: Complete scripts, fixed seeds, variance reporting
- **Documented**: Clear README, data availability, contribution guidelines
- **Versioned**: Tagged v1.0.0, ready for citation
- **Transparent**: All claims backed by reproducible benchmarks

## Critical Appraisal Items Addressed

| Item | Status | Implementation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Lock to release tag | ✅ | v1.0.0 tagged |
| Reproducibility script | ✅ | `reproduce.sh` created |
| Variance reporting | ✅ | Mean ± SD for all metrics |
| Random seeds | ✅ | Fixed seeds documented |
| Python/NumPy versions | ✅ | Added to README and DATA_AVAILABILITY |
| Reference links | ✅ | Complete list in REFERENCES.md |
| Avoid over-statement | ✅ | Professional, measured language |

The repository is ready for public release pending only the Zenodo archive creation and bioRxiv submission.
